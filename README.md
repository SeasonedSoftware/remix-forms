# Welcome to Remix Forms!

This repository contains the Remix Forms source code. We're just getting started and the APIs are unstable, so we appreciate your patience as we figure things out.

## Development

1. Clone the repo

2. Configure the web app to use the local remix-forms

```js

    "remix-forms": "*",
    //...
  },
  //...
}
```

3. Install and run

$ npm run dev
```

This will run the website at http://localhost:3000.

## Testing
